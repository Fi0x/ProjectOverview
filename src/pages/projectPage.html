                    <h1>Java Libraries</h1>
                    <h3>Projects I did for fun</h3>
                    <p>I have created three libraries for Java. Two that improve console outputs and one that simplifies
                       the creation of graphical menus.<br><br>
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/JavaLogger">JavaLogger</a> is a library, that simplifies the
                       creation of logs. It can print to the console, create log-files and send events to Mixpanel.
                       The design, layout and information of each log-line can be highly customized.<br>
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/JavaConsoleGraph">JavaConsoleGraph</a> is a library, that
                       makes it very easy to create tables and graphs in the console.<br>
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/JavaGUIMenu">JavaGUIMenu</a> is a library, that makes it very
                       easy to create simple GUI menus.<br>
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/JavaUpdater">JavaUpdater</a> is a library, that simplifies remote
                       updates of Java-projects
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/JavaDataStructures">JavaDataStructures</a> is a library, that contains
                       some useful data-types and structures for Java.</p>

                    <p>This was a project I started to improve my knowlege about spring-boot.<br>
                     It contains several spring-services that can work individually, or be linked together through a hub-service.
                    Each service was created out of a need I had and fills a specific purpose.</p>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Soph-dev">another student</a>. It is a website that shows a lot of
                       different recipes, that get loaded from a database-api. The source-code of the project is
                       available in a <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/RecipeView">GitHub-repository</a> and the website
                       is hosted <a href="https://recipe-view.netlify.app/home">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>University project</h3>
                    <p> This project was part of my studies. It is a collection of multiple small artistic programs,
                        written with <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. Most of these programs are
                        variations of exercises, that we were given in the lecture.<br>
                        The project also contains two larger programs: A synthesizer and a MIDI-sound-mixer. Both use
                        completely custom GUIs. The entire source-code is available in a
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/CreativeCoding">GitHub-repository</a> and the compiled project
                        can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/CreativeCoding/releases">here</a>.

                    <h1>Space Games</h1>
                    <h3>University projects</h3>
                    <p>During my studies, I created multiple games, of which I will introduce two of them here. Both of
                       them were made in <a href="https://unity.com/de">Unity</a>.<br>
                       The first one is a 3D first-person space-shooter called
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/space-shooter">'Asteroid Starfighter'</a>. It was created in
                       one semester with the help of three other students. In the following semester, me and
                        <a href="https://github.com/holyhibiskus">one of the other students</a> continued to polish and
                       improve the game. The final version can be downloaded
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/space-shooter/releases/tag/2.0">here</a>.<br>
                       The second game is called <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/SpaceshipBuilder">'Build a Shoot</a>.
                       It is a 2D game where you first have to build a spaceship and then control that spaceship in a
                       Space-Defender-like way. I created this game with the help of three other students. The final
                       version of the game can be downloaded
                        <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/SpaceshipBuilder/releases/tag/FinalVersionFinal">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Projects I did for fun</h3>
                    <p>I made these two tools, to simplify some tasks I had to do.<br><br>
                       The <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/EDCT">EDCT</a> was a tool for a video-game. It collected
                       data from various online-sources and used it to calculate trade-routes within the game. The tool
                       no longer works, because the websites, where data was collected, changed their layout, and I did
                       not update the tool anymore.<br>
                       The <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/LanguageGenerator">Language Generator</a> is a tool, that I
                       have developed, to create random words. It is very useful for world-building, which is what I
                       created it for. I later added spring-support, to make it compatible with my
                       <a href="https://github.com/Fi0x/HomeServerStuff">Home-Server</a>.</p>

                       It is a very large project that changes a lot in the game. I never had enough time to finish it,
