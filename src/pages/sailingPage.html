                    <h1>Racing at the lake of constance</h1>
                    <h3>2017 - now</h3>
                    <p>I started participating in races at the lake of constance in 2017 on a B/One.
                        In the first few years our crew mostly participated in a few larger races, that were close to our harbour.
                        In 2022 I joined a Diamant 2000 crew for 2 years, in which we sailed almost all races from our yacht-club, as well as some major ones around the lake.
                        Since 2024 I'm an important member on an Esse 850, on which we sailed almost every larger race on the lake, with very good results.</p>
                    <p>Ships: Esse 850, JPK 10.30, Diamant 2000, X99, Enigma 34, B/One, Folkeboot, ILC 30, J70, Sunbeam 22</p>
                    <p>Sailed distance: ~400nm/year</p>
                    <p>Races: ~20/year</p>

                    <h3>April 2025</h3>
                    <p>In April 2025 a friend invited me to join a trip on a Pogo 44 in Greece for a week.<br>
                    While we were there, a storm hit the region and forced us to sail through the Saronic Gulf, instead of the Cyclades Islands.
                        But we still had our fun with a lot of sail-switches and windspeeds up to 40kn.</p>

                    <p>Sailed distance: 165nm</p>

                    <p>In 2023 I joined a couple on their Ourborn 39 in Croatia. We sailed at the coast of Istria for two weeks.<br>
                        In their home-harbour I met the owner of a Dufour CT 1200, who invited me to sail down the Adriatic Sea for the next 6 weeks.</p>

                    <p>I completed my practical test for the SKS-license on a Dehler 38 in the Baltic Sea.<br>
                        A friend taught us the required harbour-manouvers and helped us practicing mooring manouvers in up to 25kn wind.
                        At the start of the week, we had almost no wind, but it became stronger each day. During the practical test we had 20kn inside the harbour.</p>
